# Boggle game simulator

This is a boggle game simulator built as a part of Advanced Python Programming course work.
This project is built by keeping two main aspects in mind. 

1. Modularity
2. Dependency Injection

## Details

Your task is to create a Boggle simulator. The Boggle simulator will serve as a tool to help
players practice their Boggle skills – that is, it is intended to be used by a single player.
If you don’t know the rules to Boggle, start by reading up on them here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle.
The game has the following phases:

1. The 16 dice with letters on their sides (described later) are “rolled” and randomly positioned
on a 4x4 grid. The grid is then printed out and shown to the user.
2. The player(user) begins to type the words found on the grid. The player must search for words
that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent cubes, where "adjacent" cubes
are those horizontally, vertically, and diagonally neighboring. For a word to be scored, it must
meet the following requirements:

- The word must not have already been scored.
- It must be at least three letters long.
- It must be a word in the English language. We check this against the given dictionary.
- It must be present in the 4x4 grid of dice.
- It may not use the same letter cube more than once per word.
These conditions should be checked in this order. For example, the word “OG” should be
rejected for being too short, not for being absent from the dictionary. The user entries should not
be case-sensitive.
The player must be prompted to end this phase by entering the letter ‘X’.

3. When the player elects to quit (by entering X), the player will be presented with their final
score. The player may only receive the points for the word if it meets the qualifications above.
The program should print out how many points the player received for each word and if the word
was not included, the program must print the reason. Use the exact wordings as in the examples
below. Do not print out extra sentences or lines. Finally, the program should print the total score.
Note that we do not enforce a timer as is done in traditional Boggle.
Words are awarded points according to the table below (as long as they meet the conditions
listed above):

<ins>Word length Points</ins>

- 3, 4 --> 1
- 5 --> 2
- 6 --> 3
- 7 --> 5
- 8+ --> 11

The 16 dice have the following letters on each of their six sides:

1. A E A N E G
2. A H S P C O
3. A S P F F K
4. O B J O A B
5. I O T M U C
6. R Y V D E L
7. L R E I X D
8. E I U N E S
9. W N G E E H
10. L N H N R Z
11. T S T I Y D
12. O W T O A T
13. E R T T Y L
14. T O E S S I
15. T E R W H V
16. N U I H M Qu

Note that Qu is the only two-letter sequence that appears on a single face of a die.
To verify that a word is actually present in the English language, you can check whether the
word is included in the provided file words.txt.
A few more suggestions:

- Consider a recursive approach to verifying that the word can be found within the dice grid.
Start with finding all of the possible positions where the word may start, then recursively check
each valid position for the next letter, backtracking when you determine that the word cannot be
found from that point.
- The majority of your implementation will likely rely on lists and strings. Make use of list
comprehensions for brevity and use built-in string methods to make it easier on yourself.
- Do not try to copy and paste solutions from online resources.

Some sample runs follow:
-
-----------------------------------
### Example 1 
-----------------------------------
$ python boggle.py

[O] [I] [S] [E]

[L] [R] [O] [N]

[T] [K] [N] [I]

[Y] [N] [J] [I]

Start typing your words! (press enter after each word and enter 'X' when done):

* NORSE
* RISE
* SON
* IN
* SORT
* NINE
* KIN
* NOR
* EONS
* KON
* X

The word NORSE is worth 2 points.

The word RISE is worth 1 point.

The word SON is worth 1 point.

The word IN is too short.

The word SORT is worth 1 point.

The word NINE is worth 1 point.

The word KIN is not present in the grid.

The word NOR is worth 1 point.

The word EONS is worth 1 point.

The word KON is not a word.

Your total score is 8 points!

-----------------------------------
### Example 2 
-----------------------------------
$ python boggle.py

[S] [E] [T] [T]

[O] [A] [N] [T]

[M] [O] [V] [E]

[T] [H] [E] [E]

Start typing your words! (press enter after each word and enter 'X' when done):

* TEN
* OVEN
* MOVE
* MOVED
* TEAM
* TEA
* AT
* MATE
* NAOSE
* TEA
* X

The word TEN is worth 1 point.

The word OVEN is worth 1 point.

The word MOVE is worth 1 point.

The word MOVED is not present.

The word TEAM is worth 1 point.

The word TEA is worth 1 point.

The word AT is too short.

The word MATE is worth 1 point.

The word NAOSE is not a word.

The word TEA has already been used.

Your total score is 6 points!

-----------------------------------
### Example 3
-----------------------------------
$ python boggle.py

[I] [N] [D] [E]
[E] [C] [A] [E]
[I] [S] [O] [T]
[D] [T] [M] [A]

Start typing your words! (press enter after each word and enter 'X' when done):

* NICEST
* ATOM
* TOAST
* X

The word NICEST is worth 3 points.

The word ATOM is worth 1 point.

The word TOAST is worth 2 points.

Your total score is 6 points!
